# Structural-Fault-Detection
An automated tool based on Machine learning techniques for the detection of structural failures

This repository contains the implementation of an automated structural fault detection system using machine learning techniques, as described in our research paper. The system can detect and localize structural damage in buildings by analyzing seismic sensor data.

## Research Summary

### Objective
The primary goal of this research was to develop and validate machine learning models capable of:
1. Detecting the presence of structural faults
2. Localizing structural damage within multi-story buildings

### Experimental Setup
- Construction of a scaled A36 steel structure:
  - Five slabs with 21cm separation
  - Total height: 109cm
  - Bolted beam-column connections
  - Five strategically placed piezoelectric accelerometers
- Testing conditions:
  - Simulated seismic events: Northridge (1994), Cape Mendocino (1992), Imperial Valley (1979)
  - Magnitude range: 6.4 to 7.2 Mw
  - Unidirectional shake table testing

### Methodology
1. **Data Collection**
   - ~2,500 seismic records
   - 39.15% from undamaged structure
   - 60.85% from various damage scenarios
   - Progressive damage implementation through induced hinges

2. **Signal Processing**
   - Application of weighted moving average filter
   - Extraction of 10 key intensity measures
   - Data normalization (0-1 range)

3. **Machine Learning Implementation**
   - Models implemented:
     - Random Forest (100 trees)
     - XGBoost
     - Artificial Neural Network (3 dense layers)
   - Dataset split: 80% training, 20% testing
   - Cross-validation with 5 subsets

### Results
- Model Performance:
  - Accuracy: 96-98% for both detection and localization
  - Precision, Recall, F1-score: 97-98%
- Key Findings:
  - Fourth floor measurements showed highest importance
  - Critical intensity measures identified:
    - RMS (XGBoost)
    - Predominant Frequency (Random Forest)
    - CAV (Neural Network)
